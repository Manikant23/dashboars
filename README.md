 Title: Unveiling India's Social Media Landscape: Data-driven Insights ðŸ“Š

Description:
ðŸš€ In an ambitious project, I delved into the depths of India's vibrant social media ecosystem, amassing a colossal dataset spanning across platforms like Twitter, Meta, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat. Harnessing advanced data cleaning techniques in MS Excel, including deduplication, filtering, and effective error-handling formulas, I meticulously curated the raw dataset to create a pristine repository of valuable information.

With the dataset refined, I embarked on crafting a dynamic, real-time interactive Power BI dashboard. Leveraging an array of captivating line charts and slicers, I empowered users to plunge into the intricate details of influencers' performance across various platforms. Through intuitive dropdowns, users can effortlessly select specific influencers, states, regions, and revenue sources to unravel comprehensive insights into metrics such as followers, likes, shares, comments, views, and revenue.

This bespoke dashboard not only brings clarity to the myriad facets of influencers' impact but also provides a seamless, user-friendly experience that fosters meaningful analysis and understanding.
